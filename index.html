Privacy Policy for Haptone
Last updated: August 5, 2025

Haptone ("we", "our", or "us") is developed by a single independent developer, Tyler Morey. This Privacy Policy explains how Haptone handles your data when using the app.

1. Data Collection
Haptone does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers or third parties. However, some data may be temporarily stored locally on your device to allow the app to function properly.

2. Notification Access
Haptone uses Android's notification access permission to detect notifications and trigger custom vibrations or sounds based on user-defined rules.

Notification data may be temporarily stored locally to match rules.

This data is not saved permanently, shared, or uploaded anywhere.

3. Local Data Storage
Data such as app settings, rules, or temporary notification content is stored only on your device. You can clear or remove this data at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's storage through your device settings.

4. Permissions
Haptone requires notification access to work as intended. This permission is optional but without it, the app's features will not function.

5. Third-Party Services
Haptone does not use third-party analytics, advertising platforms, or any services that collect personal data.

6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected here along with a new "Last updated" date.
